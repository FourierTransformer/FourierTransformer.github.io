Sure, the code has been online for a few days, but we all know it's the <code>README</code> that makes the program!</p>

<p>It's currently available on <a href="https://github.com/FourierTransformer/ecto-1">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I created a blog theme wwaaayy back when in late August when Paul and I were talking about websites. I revived it in late October and decided to launch November 2nd, 2014. A blog that would've launched on that wonderful day, if the static site generator I used had worked... If only the RSS feeds, static pages, custom 404's, and the odd css issue were a non-issue - but, they weren't...</p>

<h2 id="creation">Creation</h2>

<p>For the next two days, I peiced together a script that was able to pull together enough of a website to make it publishable and then "<a href="http://fouriertransformer.github.io/">http://fouriertransformer.github.io</a>" was born. It had posts and pages and could navigate without any styling issues!</p>

<h2 id="butwaittheresmore">But wait, there's more!</h2>

<p>This wasn't enough. I pushed forward, optimized, refactored, got a good handle on RSS feeds, and added a custom 404 page. All of which was can be read in slightly more detail in my <a href="http://shakilthakur.com/ecto-extended-commit-2-log/">extended commit 2 log</a> for ecto. I added some <code>CNAME</code> for github and it was good to go.</p>

<h2 id="writingthereadme">Writing the <code>README</code></h2>

<p>I always figure this should be a quick thing, but I find myself spending quite a bit of time on it - perhaps for the better! But now that it's done, I feel as people can use it and hopefully make their static-sites with it!</p>

<h2 id="thefuture">THE FUTURE</h2>

<p>From here on out, I can only hope people will use it. I know I will for as long as I'm still writing this blog. As far as updates, if I (or anyone really) have a need for anything or find a bug, I'll definitely update ecto and if if proves stable enough I'll push it up to luarocks and have a party!</p>]]></description><link>http://shakilthakur.com/ecto-is-out-there/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6ce650c6-bf5d-4300-939d-27ef3b152b48</guid><category><![CDATA[ecto]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Shakil Thakur]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2014 00:57:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[ecto: Extended Commit 2 Log]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Wow, I usually commit waaay more frequently, so "extended commit logs" shouldn't really be a thing...</p>

<h2 id="nomorewritingoutjson">No more writing out json.</h2>

<p>I was doing it before for easier debugging, but now it's gone. POOF. NADA. ZIP!</p>

<h2 id="refactor4dayz">Refactor4Dayz</h2>

<p>I suppose this happens when code isn't fully designed when it starts getting written (YAY short projects!). Apparently ghost can have multiple pages with the <a href="http://themes.ghost.org/v0.5.3/docs/structure">tag's and author's context</a> (as of ghost v0.5.3). This is the only "brute force" run-until-it-stops code that is used. The alternative was checking which post was written by what author and what tags were associated and counting it all up.</p>

<pre><code class="lang-lua">local returnCode  
local i = 2  
repeat  
    local pageDirectory = directory .. "/page/" .. i
    local pageURL = server .. pageDirectory
    local handle = io.popen("curl -s -I " .. pageURL)
    returnCode = handle:read("*l")
    handle:close()
    if returnCode:find("HTTP/1.1 200 OK") then
        os.execute("mkdir " .. pageDirectory)
        os.execute("curl -s -L -o " .. pageDirectory .. "/index.html " .. pageURL)
    end
    i = i + 1
until returnCode:find("HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily")  
</code></pre>

<p>As much as I love databases, I didn't really want to write parts of one. This was used for the <code>/author/</code> and <code>/tag/</code> pages. Side|: I had to use the <code>find</code> method as equality checking didn't work on those strings - I think it had something to do with being read from <code>popen</code> but I'm not entirely certain...</p>

<h2 id="sitemaps">Sitemaps?!</h2>

<p>I saw the epitome of JSON and was about to write a custom sitemap generator, however, apparently it's coming with ghost v0.5.4 - which is to be released in the <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/623">next few days!</a> As of now, ecto checks to see if <code>sitemap.xml</code> exists and downloads it if it does!</p>

<h2 id="rssfeeds">RSS Feeds.</h2>

<p>Blerg. This caused some angst. OOTB ghost serves rss feeds as <code>/rss/</code> and not any sort of file (with a type) and you can't really serve rss feeds as an <code>index.html</code>. So, I "compromised" by having ecto write out to <code>rss.xml</code> in the correct directory and relying on the user to modify their ghost theme files accordingly - which involves going through their theme and replacing instances of <code>/rss/</code> with <code>/rss.xml</code>.</p>

<h2 id="404pagenotfound">404 Page Not Found</h2>

<p>This is for the github users - ecto now also creates a <code>404.html</code> page! This was a minor hassel as by default ghost error page stores two images and a css file in a different directory compared to the user files. I'm not entirely sure what happens with custom error pages - so that may be worth looking in to.</p>

<h2 id="gitpush">git push</h2>

<p>The code is up on <a href="https://github.com/FourierTransformer/ecto-1">github</a> and I will likely be writing up a README for ecto tomorrow.</p>]]></description><link>http://shakilthakur.com/ecto-extended-commit-2-log/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">8c612712-fefc-4ac9-99e8-8997a0aded10</guid><category><![CDATA[ecto]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Shakil Thakur]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2014 04:58:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Getting at Ghost's Goodies (or rather handling oAuth)]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I finally got my blog up and running and what was the first thing I wanted to do? See what goodies the API had in store! Unfortunately [for me] this required some fancy authorization (oAuth) that I had never encountered before...</p>

<h2 id="readup">Read up!</h2>

<p>First things first, I read through the <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/%5BWIP%5D-API-Documentation">ghost api</a> and their page on <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/How-does-oAuth-work-with-Ghost%3F">oAuth</a>. This got me decently far: <em>"I need to make a POST request to get this 'token' thingy"</em></p>

<h2 id="tokentime">Token Time!</h2>

<p>I could make a <code>POST</code> request from the browser, but that's not how any <em>real</em> application would do it. <code>curl</code> is the magic that is needed:</p>

<pre><code>curl --data "grant_type=password&amp;username=[GHOST-EMAIL]&amp;password=[PASSWORD]&amp;client_id=ghost-admin" http://localhost:2368/ghost/api/v0.1/authentication/token/
</code></pre>

<p>That's quite a command. The <code>--data</code> is the important part that allows you to do a <code>POST</code> request on the URL. And it returns something like this beautiful piece of JSON:</p>

<pre><code>    {
  "access_token": "juIO6W4bIPemZMOmjuUHdc19Hcw6v29STFTMOHFmvLfGRnWozRuaKLGIZyiWWHETpxjesM50cY5CWX6vKuCa6PxE9tRB7vJdaI61B0f5QERmRuDymWutqzMeS7oCz92TU7Zq1fv30Chw2MOHbBmT3inLTA6JURExSV16G9TKI1b2xzdKM7iTROY9tUpucXwYKOYt5mf7m7u5ojWXwHTowWsYXPgZj1xQK6GBtEY5bEKtdqmlKfiTfVfbwhfbWOs",
  "refresh_token": "k2UDQAUGKta7d5qaqGa6ZVRY6C3fNgrLF395GyTOldUl7QZd6mS82qMWQzpBcEcdkunnDuglXT0jT39q2N7Y3vUNHjMJSEyFACjML7EhXyUnHhps1CLXCgpo4rVKud6N2dWYWOf5SVt3ApZFRtEsnH1bONYRkWtGZtsaZahd1U7F4S4ub5s9TKtkcUaMz23yPRIHoZAfy1RACekw4xAKbhMQIURYM8mysrinSxvyQ2VYtcOuofwgHFvvrrJvzSG",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="inserttoken">Insert Token</h2>

<p>Alright, we got the token! Now it's time to use it. Back on the <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/%5BWIP%5D-API-Documentation">API page</a> you'll notice a lot of commands with <code>POST</code>, <code>GET</code>, and some <code>DELETE</code>. You can run a <code>POST</code> request similar to above using <code>--data</code>, but <code>GET</code> and <code>DELETE</code> are much easier. I wanted to download the database so I could putz around with ghost-cli (which I really hope the maintainers pronounce as ghost chili).</p>

<pre><code>curl -X GET -o data.json http://localhost:2368/ghost/api/v0.1/db/?access_token=juIO6W4bIPemZMOmjuUHdc19Hcw6v29STFTMOHFmvLfGRnWozRuaKLGIZyiWWHETpxjesM50cY5CWX6vKuCa6PxE9tRB7vJdaI61B0f5QERmRuDymWutqzMeS7oCz92TU7Zq1fv30Chw2MOHbBmT3inLTA6JURExSV16G9TKI1b2xzdKM7iTROY9tUpucXwYKOYt5mf7m7u5ojWXwHTowWsYXPgZj1xQK6GBtEY5bEKtdqmlKfiTfVfbwhfbWOs
</code></pre>

<p>This time around the <code>-X GET</code> is what's doing a <code>GET</code> request and the <code>access_token</code> is just appended to the URL. Similarly a <code>-X DELETE</code> could be used on any API function that supports a <code>DELETE</code> request. Oh, and the <code>-o</code> is just dumping it the data to <code>data.json</code>.</p>

<p>Sweet, now I can use <a href="https://github.com/jeffdonthemic/ghost-cli">ghost-chili</a> and have a better understanding on handling oAuth. </p>]]></description><link>http://shakilthakur.com/getting-ghosts-goodies/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">c310b340-6c03-4957-9594-634f3cdaf37e</guid><category><![CDATA[ecto]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Shakil Thakur]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2014 03:23:19 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Test Post Please Ignore]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I used this post (along with the default one) while creating this theme and testing responsiveness and whatnot.
