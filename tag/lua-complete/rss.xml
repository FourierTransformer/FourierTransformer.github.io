<em>Note: I also should've used a squash commit, but oh well..</em></p>

<p>It was the exclude flag in the last part of the travis build:  </p>

<pre><code>after_success:  
  - luacov-coveralls -e $TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR/lua_install
</code></pre>

<p>The exclude flag doesn't just exclude certain directories, but rather certain <em>patterns</em>. lua-complete had a dash in the name, and luacov uses a <code>string.match</code> pattern in Lua to handle excludes. I had to go through some code to find it, but that ended up being the issue.</p>

<p>The fix was to just use <code>sed</code> to escape the dashes:  </p>

<pre><code>after_success:  
- EXCLUDE_DIR=`echo $TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR/lua_install | sed 's/-/%-/'`
- luacov-coveralls -e $EXCLUDE_DIR
</code></pre>

<p>I hope this helps anyone else who has issues using luacov-coveralls with projects that have dashes in the name!</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
