<h2 id="notesbookio"><a href="http://Notesbook.io">Notesbook.io</a></h2>
<p>Notesbook was my first foray into writing a backend in Golang connected to MongoDB with a frontend written in TypeScript using Mithril.js 1.0. It was a basic note taking app which encrypted notes using JavaScript's SubtleCrypto library and did compression and search in the frontend resulting in a lean backend and a [surprisingly] lean frontend (&lt; 50kb minified + gzipped). It only worked in Chrome and was glorious.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="redcrypt">RedCrypt</h2>
<p>A POC secret store using End-to-End encryption (originally loosely based on the iMessage protocol) written as a Web API in Ruby. It was later rewritten in Python with a lot of the encryption being done via PyNaCl. It was a fun little POC that taught me some basics of encryption and the dangers of implementing code yourself.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="dexter">Dexter</h2>
<p>Dexter is a modern rolodex allowing people to look up anyone insanely quick within an organization. It's written in a way that's quite easy to add lookup functionality to practically anything. Most of the development time would be in designing/developing the frontend. It was my first time using Redis, and I have to say - it was incredibly easy to use (designed extremely well) and think about as it was just extending data structures to be used as a store.</p>

<h2 id="ftcsvimgsrccontentimages201611githubmarksvgclassgithubaltgithublink">ftcsv <a href="https://github.com/FourierTransformer/ftcsv"><img src="/content/images/2016/11/github-mark.svg" class="github" alt="GitHub Link"></a></h2>
<p>ftcsv is a fast pure lua csv parser. It has support for both reading in and generating csv files and does it as quick as possible. It currently loads the entire CSV into memory and parses it into a lua table that's ready to use. Unfortunately, if it's passed a CSV that doesn't fit in memory, it'll crash. Fortunately, most of the CSVs I parse in fit in memory! I do plan on getting it to do iterative loads one day - I just need to make some time to do it! It can also do some basic transformations (skip parsing rows, renames, etc) and can use any single character as a delimiter.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="unicorndecodeimgsrccontentimages201611githubmarksvgclassgithubaltgithublink">unicorndecode <a href="https://github.com/FourierTransformer/unicorndecode"><img src="/content/images/2016/11/github-mark.svg" class="github" alt="GitHub Link"></a></h2>
<p>unicorndecode is a port of the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Unidecode">python Unidecode module</a> (which is a port of the perl <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~sburke/Text-Unidecode-1.27/lib/Text/Unidecode.pm">Text::Unidecode</a>) that converts and transliterates unicode characters to their ASCII counterparts. I ended up needing it for a pre-processor of a typeahead, because people might not type in unicode characters while filling in a field. The dev version is currently available on <a href="https://luarocks.org/modules/fouriertransformer/unicorndecode">LuaRocks</a>. I want to revisit unicode parsing in lua &lt; 5.3 to make it safer and use the built-in support for unicode in lua &gt; 5.3 before release.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="jenni">Jenni</h2>
<p>Jenni is a fake data generator that aims to be as realistic as possible and insanely quick. It uses things like census data and the zipcode database to rapidly return real sounding names and addresses. It can generate both real and fake phone numbers based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan">North American Numbering Plan</a> as well as various office-related things (mailstops, titles, ids, etc). I want to verify the redistribution of some of the source material before putting it up on GitHub, but it's worked amazingly well for me for generating fake data.</p>

<h2 id="mobilecomicsimgsrccontentimages201611githubmarksvgclassgithubaltgithublink">MobileComics <a href="https://github.com/FourierTransformer/MobileComics"><img src="/content/images/2016/11/github-mark.svg" class="github" alt="GitHub Link"></a></h2>
<p>MobileComics was a fun project I made that tried to solve the problem that web comics have on mobile: they just don't display well. MobileComics takes a comic strip and figures out where each panel is, the correct numbering, and will then crop out the relevant sections. I then make an imagemap over the original comic where the panels would link to their cropped versions displayed in the lightbox. I had a lot of fun making this POC and you can see the final version <a href="http://fouriertransformer.github.io/MobileComics/">here!</a></p>

<h2 id="dailymathimgsrccontentimages201611githubmarksvgclassgithubaltgithublink">DailyMath <a href="https://github.com/FourierTransformer/DailyMath"><img src="/content/images/2016/11/github-mark.svg" class="github" alt="GitHub Link"></a></h2>
<p>DailyMath was the first public webapp I released. It was a rather ambitious website where I would post a new math problem everyday and have people attempt to solve it. Everyday soon became three times a week, and is now defunct. I learned a lot about tradeoffs between secrecy, bandwith, and speed and pushing code to the frontend or backend depending on the need.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="ecto1imgsrccontentimages201611githubmarksvgclassgithubaltgithublink">ecto-1 <a href="https://github.com/FourierTransformer/ecto-1"><img src="/content/images/2016/11/github-mark.svg" class="github" alt="GitHub Link"></a></h2>
<p>A static site generator for ghost-blogs (like this one!) that pulls the database from the api and tries to piece together sites by marching through slugs. It's still in its early stages, but I am using it for this blog! I want to rewrite it at some point so it's less hacked together. Perhaps I'll get to that one day!</p>

<h2 id="tablesaltimgsrccontentimages201611githubmarksvgclassgithubaltgithublink">TableSalt <a href="https://github.com/FourierTransformer/TableSalt"><img src="/content/images/2016/11/github-mark.svg" class="github" alt="GitHub Link"></a></h2>
<p>A Constraint Satisfaction Framework written in Lua. I wanted to create an extensible way to solve constraint satisfaction problems such as sudoku, kakuro, cryptarithmetic, coloring problems, and so on. One of the benefits of TableSalt is that it doesn't require input in some special mathematical form or use some crazy graphical interface - it's just pure lua (and it runs hella fast using <a href="http://luajit.org/">LuaJit</a>)</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="sudokusolverimgsrccontentimages201611githubmarksvgclassgithubaltgithublink">Sudoku Solver <a href="https://github.com/FourierTransformer/SudokuSolver"><img src="/content/images/2016/11/github-mark.svg" class="github" alt="GitHub Link"></a></h2>
<p>This was created because I needed something to verify that TableSalt was working correctly! At some point I want to create a dynamic parser and turn this into a sudoku solving web app! But for now, it can solve a couple different sudoku puzzles, mostly taken from Peter Norvig's <a href="http://norvig.com/sudoku.html">wonderful sudoku page</a></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="kakurosolverimgsrccontentimages201611githubmarksvgclassgithubaltgithublink">Kakuro Solver <a href="https://github.com/FourierTransformer/KakuroSolver"><img src="/content/images/2016/11/github-mark.svg" class="github" alt="GitHub Link"></a></h2>
<p>It was created after I had gotten TableSalt up to a more usable state and was testing out implementing new constraints and how easy it was to plug it into TableSalt.</p>

<h2 id="boidracersimgsrccontentimages201611githubmarksvgclassgithubaltgithublink">Boid Racers <a href="https://github.com/FourierTransformer/Boid_Racers"><img src="/content/images/2016/11/github-mark.svg" class="github" alt="GitHub Link"></a></h2>
<p>This was Nate Balas and my final project for our Artifical Intelligence class. It was a tool simulating various AI concepts discussed in class including procedural generation, pathfinding, and <a href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/">boid flocking and steering</a>. It was written using <a href="http://love2d.org/">LOVE</a> and gave us a taste of writing retina-ready applications.<br>

<hr>
<h2 id="srtrim">srtrim</h2>
<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip">SubRip</a> subtitle trimmer written in go-lang. It handled trimming and delays in the srt format. I really need to find this code, throw it up somewhere, and do a proper release. Perhaps I'll get to it one day.</p>
