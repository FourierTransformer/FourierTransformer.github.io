                <p>I get into many different things. Little projects, big projects, grandiose ideas and I tell my friends about 'em. My friends told me to share it with the world and here we are.</p>

<p>Below you'll find a bunch of projects that I'll blog about listed as the ones that were most recently worked on first. As you'll start to notice, I have a tendency to work on a lot of different projects at the same time. Occasionally things get put on the back-burner (for a long time) and I don't really want them there. I hope that keeping track of progress will avoid this sort of situation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ecto-1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A static site generator for ghost-blogs (like this one!) that pulls the database from the api and tries to peice together sites by marching through slugs. It's still in its early stages, but is now managing to get this blog up and running!</p>

<p>The code is up on <a href="http://github.com/FourierTransformer/ecto-1">GitHub</a> and you can track some of the development through the <a href="/tag/ecto">ecto tag</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TableSalt</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A Constraint Satisfaction Framework written in Lua. I wanted to create an extensible way to solve constraint satisfaction problems such as sudoku, kakuro, cryptarithmetic, coloring problems, and so on. One of the benefits of TableSalt is that it doesn't require input in some special mathematical form or use some crazy graphical interface - it's just pure lua (and it runs hella fast using <a href="http://luajit.org/">LuaJit</a>)</p>

<p>You can find the code up on <a href="https://github.com/FourierTransformer/TableSalt">GitHub</a></p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Sudoku Solver</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was created because I needed something to verify that TableSalt was working correctly! At some point I want to create a dynamic parser and turn this into a sudoku solving web app! But for now, it can solve a couple different sudoku puzzles, mostly taken from Peter Norvig's <a href="http://norvig.com/sudoku.html">wonderful sudoku page</a></p>

<p>You can find the code up on <a href="https://github.com/FourierTransformer/SudokuSolver">GitHub</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Crescent</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A lua wiki I was working on to get a better handle at managing databases and getting a feel for <a href="http://leafo.net/lapis/">Lapis</a> for lua web development. It's currently on hold.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Fondant</p>
</blockquote>

<p>?Err: [[information not found]]?</p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>Kakuro Solver</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was created after I had gotten TableSalt up to a more usable state and was testing out the implementation of custom constraints. It's currently on the backburner.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Boid Racers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was Nate Balas and my final project for our Artifical Intelligence class. It was a tool simulating various AI concepts discussed in class including procedural generation, pathfinding, and <a href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/">boid flocking and steering</a>. It was written using <a href="http://love2d.org/">LOVE</a> and gave us a taste of writing retina-ready applications. <br />

<p>You can find the code up on <a href="https://github.com/FourierTransformer/Boid_Racers">GitHub</a></p>

<hr />

<blockquote>
  <p>srtrim</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip">SubRip</a> subtitle trimmer written in go-lang. It handled trimming and delays in the srt format. I really need to find this code, throw it up somewhere, and do a proper release. Perhaps I'll get to it one day.</p>
